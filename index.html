                <p id="mother-par"> Trevor Noah's life story is quite remarkable, starting from apartheid South Africa. Born to a white father and a black Xhosa mother during a time when their union was illegal, Trevor had to be kept indoors by his mother to avoid being taken away by the government. After the end of South Africa’s oppressive white rule, Trevor and his mother embraced their newfound freedom. 

                    Trevor Noah’s mother Patricia is very loving. She sounds like such an amazing woman and it’s so clear how much he loves and respects her. The way she broke every barrier put in front of her so she could get every advantage for her and her son was really inspiring and she’s like a brave, funny, and incredible woman.

                <p id="racism">Noah also show how the racist society into which he was born means he can’t possibly fit in as a member of any group. Despite his facility with language, Noah never truly belongs. He never has a home group where he is surrounded by people like himself. But most other mixed-race children are smuggled out of South Africa because their lives are unbearable. Noah is one of the few who remained, and he is constantly in situations where he needs to choose whether to identify with Black peers, Colored ones, or white ones.
                    Even Noahs extended family treats him differently because he is a different color than they are. His parents can’t take him to the park. He isn’t permitted to play in the street with his cousins in a Black town. His grandmother is so horrified at the vivid bruising that shows up on Noah’s skin after a beating that she refuses to discipline him. Noah is usually alone and always different.

            <div id="education">
                <p id="edu-par">Noah and his mother also use education to imagine the better lives they want and set their minds to pursuing and improving their chances at a job. This is not just formal education, but thinking critically, which Patricia instills in Noah from an early age. Patricia spoke to Trevor  like an adult and teaches him English, gives him books and shows him places black people never went  so that he will know that the ghetto is not the world. Trevor learns to think for himself .Like white children, he learns he should speak up for himself, that his ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered. Likewise, Patricia’s own success is largely due to her schooling: because she managed to learn English in a mission school and pursue specialized job training, she could get the job as a secretary that allowed her to raise her children on her own.

                <p id="interact">The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. </p>
